For Mac users: open the "Terminal" app, type "g++" and press enter.
If the compiler is not already, you will prompted to install it. 
Chose the option to install it, wait for the installation to finish.
After that, you're good to go!

For Windows users: 
- open cmd or powershell, type "g++ -v" without quotes, press enter
- if you get an error, proceed forward, otherwise you have mingw (g++) installed
- open the link http://grav.ejudge.kz/distr
- download the "mingw-vscode" archive
- unpack it wherever you prefer
- move the unpacked "mingw-vscode" folder into the root of the C:\ drive
- run the file called "run" (or "run.bat")
- if prompted, choose "Run anyway"
- reopen (or open) cmd or powershell, type "g++ -v" without quotes, press enter
If you have no errors at this point, you're good to go!
